Google Analytics Capstone Project using Cyclistic (Divvy) bike data

This Case Study was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.

Objective (Ask Phase)
To analyse how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in order to determine the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

Prepare Phase
The data was downloaded directly from the Divvy Bikes website: https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data

It was organised by month, and assumed to be credible since it was compiled and published by the organisation. There were some anomalies in the data 
Process Phase

After regularising and importing the data, the first step was to inspect each attribute for anomalies. A new column for trip length (in minutes) was created. Any data I was uncertain about was marked for exclusion from the final dataset. A full description of the process is described here:  https://github.com/mombali1/google-capstone/blob/50c58801b7423267d9c4ba9e2e8612113ee2de90/bike%20share%20data

Analyse Phase
In this phase, queries were created to uncover trends that were highlighted in the data visualisations.

Share Phase
Visualisations were created using Tableau. Published here https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mo3184/viz/bikesharecapstone/Dashboard1?publish=yes and included in the powerpoint presentation.
